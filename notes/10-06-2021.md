### **Distributed Systems**
* **Node** - physically identifiable object (computer)
* **Process** - A thread running on a node

### **System Assumptions**
* internal synchronization among processes on a node is dime via **shared memory** (OpenMP, **PThreads**, Posix threads)
* processes on different nodes can communicate only by sending and receiving messages (mpi)
