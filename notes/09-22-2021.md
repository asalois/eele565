Process P
int M, Sum, Element
channel: N,S,E,W
loop forever:
    P1: Element <-- N
    P2: Sum <-- E
    P3: Sum = Sum + M.Element
    P4: S <-- Element
    P5: W <-- Sum
```
**Selective Input** - a process can attempt to communicate with more than one channel at the same time.
```
either:
    var1 <= ch1
or:
    var2 <= ch2
or:
    var3 <= ch3
```
A process won't block if any communication can take place on ch1 to ch3
- we don't know which one will be chosen

### **Spaces**
#### **Linda Model**
- decouples process - sender and receivers don't have to exist simultaneously
- shared data is **persistent**
- The model defines a global data structure called a **space** (think giant bulletin board) on which **notes** are posted
- **Note**
  - A sequence of typed elements
  - the first element is a character literal that conveys the meaning of the note
  - **Example** ('a' <= character, 27 <= int, false <= boolean)
- **Matching** occurs is
    1. The sequence of types of the parameters equals the sequence of the types of the note
    2. If a parameter is not a variable, the values must match
    3. If a parameter is a formal parameter, then the variebl only matches the **current value** of the variable
- **Atomic Statements**
  - postnote(v1,v2,...)
    - creates a note fro the variable and posts is in the space
    - if there are processes blocked and several match, one of the matched processes will be unblocked 
  - removenote(x1,x2,...)
    - remove a note that matches and assigns its value to the parameters
    - if there is no match, the proccess is blocked
    - if multiple matches, an arbitrary one is removed
  - readnote(x1,x2,...)
    - like remove note, but leaves the note in the space
