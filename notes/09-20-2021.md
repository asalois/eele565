### Eating Philosopher 
``` python
mointor cs:
    int array[1...5] of cs <-[2,2,2,2,2]
    condition array[1...5] of OktoEat

operation take_cs(int i):
    if cs[i] ~= 2:
        waitc(OktoEat[i])
    cs[i+1] = cs[i+1] -1
    cs[i-1] = cs[i-1] -1

operation release_cs(int i):
    cs[i+1] = cs[i+1] +1

### Channels
* Synchronous Communication - THe exchange of the message is an atomic operation requiring actions of both the sender and receiver (telephone call)
  * two way or one way data
  * the sender will be blocked if the receiver is not ready
  * the receiver will be blocked if it has to wait for the sender
* Asynchronous Communications
  * must be able to buffer a potentially large number of messages (email)
  * usually implemented in software (to manage buffer)
  * one way data flow
* Addressing
  * Asymmetric - sender know the address of the receiver , but no vice versa
  * Symmetric - message contain address of sender and receiver
  * None - senders broadcast message with no address
    * matching occurs on message structure (bulletin boards)
* Channel - connects a sender and a receiver
  * typed

Examples
* Synchronous Channel
  * Producer-COnsumer (channels)
``` python
ch i int channel

producer:
    int x
    loop forever:
        x = produce() # p1
        ch <= x # p2

consumser:
    int y
    loop forever:
        y <= ch # q1
        consume(y) # q2

```
**Note:** processes will be blocked until (p2,q1,...) occurs when state(p2,q1,...) executes, this is the same as  y-x
Channels in operating systems are called pipes

lets create a custom ship for a 3x3 matrix multiplication and use synchronous one-way channels.

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\
                4 & 4 & 6 \\ 
                7 & 8 & 9 \end{bmatrix} *

\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\
                0 & 1 & 2 \\
                1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 & 6 \\
                10 & 5 & 18 \\ 
                16 & 8 & 20 \end{bmatrix}                 
$$
