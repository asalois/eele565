## Complex Atomic Statements
#### Test and Set
Test and Set - is an atomic statement defined as the execution of **two** statements with no possible interleaving between them.

test-and-set(common,local) is  
    local = common          -| executed in sequence with **no** interruption  
    common = 1              -|  

##### **Critical Section example**  
common = 0  
##### **Process P**  
int localp  
loop forever  
1. NC  
2. test-and-set(common,localp)  
3. until localp = 0  
4. CS  
5. common = 0  

##### **Process Q**  
int localq  
loop forever  
1. NCS  
2. test-and-set(common,localq)  
3. until localq = 0  
4. CS  
5. common = 0  

#### **Atomic Exchange**
``` python
exchange(a,b) is  
    int temp  
    temp = a   #-|  
    a =  b     # | no interruption  
    b = temp   #-|  
```

#### **Atomic fetch-and-add**
``` python
fetch-and-add(common,local)  
    local = common  
    common += 1  
```

#### **Atomic compare-and-swap**
``` python
compare-and-swap(common,old,new)  
    int temp  
    temp = common  
    if common == old  
        common = new  
    return temp  
```

### The Bakery Algorithm

### Semaphores
**Assumptions** - A **process** can be in any one of the following states

Ready -> Running -> Completed
Inactive -> Ready -> Running -> Completed
Inactive -> Ready -> Blocked

* A **scheduler** decide which of the ready process should run
* A **blocked** process can not be choses by the scheduler to run next. An external action must unblock the process

**Definition** - A Semaphore S is a data type with two fields:  
* S.v where v is a non-negative integer
* S.l where l is a **set** of processes 
``` python
Semaphore S = (k,w)
    i.e. 
    S.v = k
    S.l = w
```
