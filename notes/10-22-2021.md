### **Byzantine Generals Algorithm**
* a group of Byzantine armies is attacking a city
* if they **attack together** they will win (capture city)
* if they do not attack together, they must **retreat together** to avoid defeat
* the general of the armies have **reliable messengers** who deliver messages between generals
* some generals may be **traitors** who will try to bring defeat to the Byzantine armies
* the **loyal** general must come to a consensus (a tied vote = retreat)


generals = nodes (can fail)
messengers = communications channels (assumed to be perfectly reliable)
**Crash Failures** - a traitor (failure node) simply stops sending messages
**Byzantine Failures** - a traitor sends arbitrary messages

``` python
planType finalPlan
planType array[num of generals] plan
planType array[num of generals,num of generals] reportedPlan
planType array[num of generals] majorityPlan

# round 1 
plan[myID] = choosePlan()
for all other generals G:
    send(G,myID,plan[myID])

for all other generals G:
    receive(G,plan[G]) # plans now holds the plan from each general

# round 2
for all other generals G:
    for all other generals G_prime except G:
        send(G_prime,myID,G,plan[G]) # send to general G_prime that I received plan[G] from general G

for all other generals G:
    for all other generals G_prime except G:
        receive(G,G_prime,reportedPlan[G]) # the plan g reported receiving from G_prime

# vote number 1
for all other generals G:
    majorityPlan[G] = majority(plan[G] Union reportedPlan[*,G])
    # plan received from general G Union reported plans from G received from other generals
    # the result is the real intention of general G

# vote number 2
majorityPlan[myID] = plan[myID]
finalPlan = majority(majorityPlan) # the majority vote based on the the real intentions of all the generals
```

#### **Crash Failure** 
Basil crashes between sending a message to Leo (message sent) and Zoe (message not sent)
*  Zoe - loyal - plan A
*  Leo -loyal - plan R
*  Basil - traitor - plan A sent to Leo then crashes

Leo
| General | Plan | Basil | Zoe | Majority |
|---------|------|-------|-----|----------|
| Basil   | A    | -     | x   | A        |
| Leo     | R    | -     | -   | R        |
| Zoe     | A    | x     | -   | A        |
|         |      |       |     | A        |

Zoe
| General | Plan | Basil | Leo | Majority |
|---------|------|-------|-----|----------|
| Basil   | x    | -     | A   | A        |
| Leo     | R    | x     | -   | R        |
| Zoe     | A    | -     | -   | A        |
|         |      |       |     | A        |

bottom line N = 3t + 1
N is number of generals
t is number of traitors

| Traitors | Generals | Messages |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1        | 4        | 36       |
| 2        | 7        | 392      |
| 3        | 10       | 1740     |
| 4        | 13       | 5408     |

### **King Algorithms**
N = 4t + 1
| Traitors | Generals | Messages |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1        | 5        | 48       |
| 2        | 9        | 240      |
| 3        | 13       | 672      |
| 4        | 17       | 1440     |
