### **The Producer-Consumer Problem**
An order of execution problem

#### Case 2 : bounded buffer
we want to ensure that the consumer does not take from an empty buffer  

Below is using a technique called a **Split Semaphore**  notEmpty + notFull = N


buffer = finite FIFO
Semaphore notEmpty(0,empty)
Semaphore notFull(N,empty)

##### Producer
* loop forever
* data = produce()
* wait(notFull)
* send_to_buffer(data,buffer)
* signal(notEmpty)


##### Consumer
* loop forever
* wait(NotEmpty)
* data = take_from_buffer(buffer)
* signal(notFull)
* consume(data)

### **The Dining Philosopher Problem**

5 philosophers = [p1,p2,p3,p4,p5] where px = philosopher x
5 chopsticks = [u1,u2,u3,u4,u5] where ux = chopstick x

Philosopher will think or eat

Conditions for correctness
* A philosopher can only eat with two chopsticks
* A chopstick cannot be held by two philosophers (Mutual Exclusion)
* Freedom from deadlock
* Freedom from starvation
* Efficient behavior in absence of contention 

let cs = array[1...5] of semaphores with initial values of 1  
cs = [1,1,1,1,1]  
#### Process_i
* loop forever
* think
* wait(cs[i])
* wait(cs[i-1]) # if i-1 = 0 then i = 5
* eat
* signal(cs[i])
* signal(cs[i-1])  

DEADLOCK!  

Try Again

weak semaphore cs = [1,1,1,1,1]  
strong semaphore eat = 4
#### Process_i
* loop forever
* think
* wait(eat)
* wait(cs[i])
* wait(cs[i-1]) # if i-1 = 0 then i = 5
* eat
* signal(cs[i])
* signal(cs[i-1])
* signal(eat)
