### **Monitors**
* Generalization of the kernel found in OS
* One creates a separate monitor for each group of objects that requires synchronization
* Felids of the monitor are all private (OOP)
* The monitor adds the requirement that only one process can execute an operation on an object (monitor) at any one time
* The monitor is static, it is just as set of operations that **"sit there"** waiting for a process to invoke them
* There is an implicit lock the **"door"**
* ensure atomic actions

### Example
```python
n = 0
P:
    int temp
    temp =n
    n = temp + 1

Q:
    int temp
    temp =n
    n = temp + 1

Monitor CS:
    int n = 0
    operation increment
        int temp
        temp = n
        n = temp +1
```

### **Condition Variables**
* A variable that will block a process checking it
* If a process is blocked, it is said to be blocked on the condition
* Each condition variable has a FIFO of blocked processes

#### **A Monitor Simulating a Semaphore**
##### monitor Semaphore

``` python
int s = k
condition notZero: # <- by convention cv are named with the condition you want true
    operation wait:
        if s = 0:
            waitC(notZero) # <- read as "wait for notZero to be true"
        s = s + 1
    operation signal:
        s = s + 1
        signalC(notZero) # <- read as "signal that notZero is true"

waitC(condV):
    append p to condV
    p.state = blocked
    monitor.lock = release

signalC(condV):
    if condV ~= empty:
        remove q from FIFO
        q.state = read 
```
**Semaphore**
* wait(s) may or may not block
* signal(s) always has an effect
* signal(s) unblock and arbitrary block process (weak)
* A process unblocked by signal(s) can resume execution immediately 

**Monitor**
* waitC(condV) always blocks
* signalC(condV) has no effect if the FIFO is empty
* signalC(condV) unblock the head of the queue
* A process unblocked by signalC(condV) must wait for the signaling to process to leave the monitor

**Note:** monitors have a function 
``` python
empty(condV):
    return (condV = empty)
```
that returns true if no block processes on the condition

#### **Producer-Consumer Example**
``` python
def monitor_PC:
    buffer(empty)
    condition notEmpty
    condition notFull

    operation append(datatypeV):
        if buffer.isFull:
            waitC(notFull)
        append(V,buffer)
        signalC(notEmpty)

    operation take():
        datatype n
        if buffer.isEmpty:
            waitC(notEmpty)
        w = head(buffer)
        signal(notFull)
        return W

def Producer:
    loop forever:
        d = produce()
        PC.append(d)

def Consumer:
    loop forever
    d = PC.take
    consume(d)
```
