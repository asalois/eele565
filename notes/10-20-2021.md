### **Reusable Barrier** better solution #2

```python
init:
    turnstile1 = semaphore(0) # initially locked
    turnstile2 = semaphore(1) # initially open
    mutex = semaphore(1) # initially open

main:
    rendezvous
    mutex.wait()
        count = count + 1
        if count = N # N is number of threads
            for N:
                turnstile1.signal() # unlock first
    mutex.signal()

    turnstile1.wait()
    CP
    
    mutex.wait()
        count = count + 1
        if count == 0:
                for N:
                    turnstile2.signal() # unlock second
    mutex.signal()

    turnstile2.wait()
```

### **Distributed Systems**
* **fail-safe** : one or more failures does not cause damage
* **fault-tolerant** : a system continues to fulfill its requirements with one or more failures

### **Byzantine Generals Algorithm**
* a group of Byzantine armies is attacking a city
* if they **attack together** they will win (capture city)
* if they do not attack together, they must **retreat together** to avoid defeat
* the general of the armies have **reliable messengers** who deliver messages between generals
* some generals may be **traitors** who will try to bring defeat to the Byzantine armies
* the **loyal** general must come to a consensus (a tied vote = retreat)


generals = nodes (can fail)
messengers = communications channels (assumed to be perfectly reliable)
**Crash Failures** - a traitor (failure node) simply stops sending messages
**Byzantine Failures** - a traitor sends arbitrary messages
